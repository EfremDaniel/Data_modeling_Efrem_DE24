# Data_modeling_Efrem_DE24

This project is part of my learning process in data modeling. The goal is to understand how to design databases using the three main steps: conceptual, logical, and physical models.

The repository includes example models and SQL scripts built for a fictional case. I'm using PostgreSQL to practice creating tables, relationships, and applying good database structure and normalization.

ðŸŽ¯ What I'm Learning

How to design database structures from scratch
How to create ER models and convert them into relational schemas
How to write SQL to build and organize a database
How to apply best practices like normalization and use of primary/foreign keys
